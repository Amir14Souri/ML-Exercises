## Description

This repository contains my jupyter notebooks, based on my understandings of chapters of the below book.

notebooks contain a brief explanation, related formulas, and some examples of each Machine Learning model covered in **Part I** of the book.

## Book

The book I have read is **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2nd Edition)**.

You can purchase the book using [this link](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646).

*This repository contains only the ML models covered in **first Part (Chapters 1 to 9)** of this book.*

## Content

jupyter notebooks' titles are descriptive; chapter which covers the related ML model and a short description is mentioned though.

Chapter 1 introduces Machine Learning general concepts, types, and challanges, so there is no notebook for this chapter.
